## ✨ Overview

> A solo-builder playground to tinker with Rise Chain’s infrastructure.  
> Lightweight, fast, and ready for the modular multichain future.

This repo is part of the **Ride with Rise** testnet initiative — focused on early experimentation with:

- ⚡ Real-time block & transaction RPC queries  
- 🧱 Node interaction & testnet latency tests  
- 🛠️ Dev-focused tooling for onchain dApps  
- 🧬 Future plans: CLI utils, indexers, or whatever

## 🌐 Why Rise?

Because the current L1s are good.  
But not fast enough. Not modular enough. Not *Rise* enough.

- 🧠 Powered by MoveVM  
- ⚙️ Modular runtime, scalable infra  
- 🚀 Sub-100ms latency goal  
- 🧩 Built for DePIN, RWA, onchain games, real-time social
