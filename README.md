# 🔧 rise-toolbox

A minimalist sandbox project to explore the Rise Chain testnet and experiment with its modular, high-performance blockchain infrastructure.

## ✨ About

This is a personal exploration space as part of the **"Ride with Rise"** campaign.

I'm currently learning the ropes of Rise Chain's architecture, RPC structure, and modular capabilities. This repo is intended to document experiments and small tools related to:

- 🔹 Block and transaction queries via Rise RPC
- 🔹 Real-time latency monitoring
- 🔹 Potential Move-based dApp structure in the future
- 🔹 Tooling for developers and validators on Rise

## 🧠 Why Rise?

Rise stands out as a **hyper-performant modular chain**, aiming for:
- 🧠 High-throughput Move-based execution
- ⚡ Ultra-low latency (<100ms goal)
- 🔩 Full modularity (choose your consensus, execution, etc.)
- 🔥 Ideal for onchain social, gaming, DePIN, RWA & more

It’s not just another L1 — it’s building the rails for apps that can’t even run properly on today’s infra.

## 🧪 What This Repo Will Become

For now, it’s just a placeholder with some notes and maybe early CLI tests.
But in the future, I plan to explore:

- `rise-ping`: a tool to benchmark RPC responsiveness
- `rise-index-lite`: mini indexer for testnet activity
- Basic Move interaction via CLI
- ...or maybe something we haven't imagined yet
